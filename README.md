# Todo list Application created with Vue 3 

This application was created using Vue3 and composition API. It's a todo list application that will save all your data in the local storage which means even when you refresh the page or come back after some time, the data will still be stored. 

You can divide your todos in different categories like Business or Personal and the todos will be shown accordingly. 

You can mark a todo as done, edit it after it's created or simply delete it if you don't want it to be there.

The app is deployed  [here](todolist-ninad.netlify.app).
